# Trying to make some Attack on Titan style movement.

This is my attempt at simulating
the 3d movuevers from Attack on Titan. 
More or less inspired by the roblox game "Attack on Titan Revolution" using raylib.

## TODO
-Sounds
-firstperson weapon model
-shader performance (shadows)
-Better grapple logic/grapple assist
-Post processing

# Thanks
Thanks to raylib for making making games so easy!
